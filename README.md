# Weather-app.js

This project is my first project using an API, and I am glad that it turned out quite well, if you want to see the code feel free to copy the repository and modify it to your liking. It is a project personally I get something out of my gray hair as we say here in Venezuela, but like all good programmers we solve problems on a daily basis and this has not been the exception.

For me, it is an honor that you see this project and that you have entered my repository, I hope you comment positive things about the project and if you have an easier or more intuitive way to do the code please let me know and I will review your corrections. Many thanks

#Proceso de Codigo.

In this project, I used tools like Webpack, Bootstrap, vanilla JavaScript, and obviously the must-have HTML. Mainly, I used Webpack to create a development environment with which I felt comfortable, so that I would have a server ready to see any changes in real time, it should be noted that I do not use VS Code but the vim editor and that is why I need a server to see the changes, after configuring Webpack and not dying trying, I set out to structure my application in HTML, and in order not to take forever styling with the native CSS, I used bootstrap to focus on what I wanted to implement which was the code and API incorporation, after all use JavaScript classes to more easily use the API I was using which is called openweathermap
